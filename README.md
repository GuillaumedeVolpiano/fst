Finite state transducers
========================

A Haskell package for construction and running of finite state
transducers, as based on the concepts of transducers and regular
relations developed by Xerox.  The syntax of Xerox's fst program has
functioned as an inspiration for the syntax of fstStudio.

The application was written purely in Haskell, and is intended to be a
tool for the Haskell programmer, especially for ones that develop
language applications.

This repository covers versions 0.10.0.0+ and was started when the
original version of the package (0.9.0.1) was revived by
[Baldur Bl√∂ndal](https://github.com/Icelandjack) and
[John J. Camilleri](https://github.com/johnjcamilleri).
